I wanted to add a quick note about how this site is hosted and share some thoughts on it. I've moved this site several times, more than I can remember. In no particular order, I've used:

-  Netlify
-  Vercel
-  Cloudflare Pages
-  Sevalla  

To continue from my previous post, I'm transitioning as much as possible to European alternatives to US services. All the companies I've used above are US-based, and it hasn't been easy to find a provider located in the EU. I've considered self-hosting with Hetzner and Coolify, but it wasn't worth it for a site this simple.

My current solution is to move to [statichost.eu](https://www.statichost.eu/), a Swedish company based in Stockholm. The UI isn't as polished as Sevalla, which I previously used, but this is running on their free plan and has worked great so far.

The final step is to transfer the domain from Porkbun, which is difficult for me since I really like their service and have been a customer for nearly 10 years. When I finally do it, I'll probably switch to Oderland, but unfortunately, they don't offer nearly as many TLDs as Porkbun. This makes purchasing dumb or funny domains not an option. 
There's no real timeline for this change, but it's a small step in the right direction.
