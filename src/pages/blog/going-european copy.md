I just wanted to add a quick note about how this site is hosted and some thoughs about it.
I've moved this site several times, more than I can remember actually.
In no particular order, I've used:
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Pages
- Sevalla

To continued from my previos post I'm moving as much as possible to European alternatives to US services. All the companies I've used above are US based and it's not been that easy to find a provider that is based in the EU.
I've looked into self-hosting, using Hetzner and Coolify. But it was not really worth it for a site this simple.

So my current solution to this is that I'm moving to [statichost.eu](https://www.statichost.eu/). It's a Swedish company based in Stockholm.
The UI is nowhere near as polished as Sevalla, that I previously used, but this is running on their free plan and has worked great so far.

The final step is to move the domain from Porkbun, which pains me since I really like the service and have been a customer for close to 10 years now.
When I finally do it I'll probably move to Oderland, but unfortunately they don't have nearly as many TLDs as Porkbun. So buying stupid or funny domains is kind of not an options there.
So no real timeline to change that but this is a small step in the right direction.
