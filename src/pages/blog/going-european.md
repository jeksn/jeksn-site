With the current political turmoil I've really soured on using American services and want to move as much as I can to European alternatives.

There are a few sites already that lists alternatives both to products and digital services. The best ones I've found are [Go European](https://www.goeuropean.org/)
and [European Alternatives](https://european-alternatives.eu/).

I've already moved over to Proton from Google a few years back and will likely never go back.
Proton also has several different products which makes their subscription a pretty good deal.

I plan on moving my domains from Porkbun, which is a fantastic service and has worked great for years, to the Swedish provider Oderland. I don't really have that many domains and the ones I've bought over the years usually expire since it's just small projects that don't need custom domains. I usually run them as a subdomains to my main site anyway now.

Hosting is the trickier part since Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages etc. work great with generous free plans. 
Right now I keep most site on either Sevalla (where this site is hosted) and Cloudflare Pages.
The simplest alternative right now is [statichost.eu](https://www.statichost.eu/) which is hosted in Sweden. 
But there is also [FastFront.io](https://www.fastfront.io/?) which is currently under a waitlist so will keep an eye on that.

Of course, I can't completely escape US services, but I can at least do my best to support companies that benefit Europe. Hopefully, this will gain momentum, and we can encourage more innovation from Europe.
